Description:
The program consists of 4 parts. The first part is a library where students can get a quick acces to several programming languages. The second program calculates your average GPA.
Inside the 3rd program, you can insert quick notes that will be stored in a note folder inside the application. The last application opens the webbrowser and lets you read the documentation in pdf.
